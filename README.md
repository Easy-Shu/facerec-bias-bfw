This paper has been submitted for publication in _15th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition
 on Automatic Facial and Gesture Recognition (FG2020)_.

## Overview
Our findings reveal a bias in scoring sensitivity across different subgroups when verifying the identity of a subject
using facial images. In other words, the performance of a FR system on different subgroups (e.g., male vs female, 
asian vs black) typically depends on a global threshold (i.e., decision boundary on scores or distances to determine 
whether true or false pair). Our work uses fundamental signal detection theory to show that the use of a single, 
global threshold causes a skew in performance ratings across different subgroups. For this, we demonstrate that 
subgroup-specific thresholds are optimal in terms of overall performance and balance across subgroups.

Furthermore, we built and released the facial image dataset needed to address bias from this view of FR. Namely, _Bias
Faces in the Wild_ (BFW).

## Abstract

We reveal critical insights into problems of bias in state-of-the-art facial recognition (FR) systems using a novel Balanced Faces In the Wild (BFW) dataset: data balanced in gender and for ethnic groups. Classic signal detection theory was applied to understand the score distribution across different subgroups. Specifically, in face verification using Arc-Face, we show that the optimal threshold varies across different subgroups of face-pairs. Thus, the conventional approach of learning a single, global threshold on all data yields a threshold biased to subgroups. We leveled out performances across different subgroups while improving the overall performance by learning a threshold per subgroup. Furthermore, we conduct a human evaluation to measure the bias in humans (i.e., within versus across subgroups), which supports the hypothesis that such a bias exists in human perception.

## Software implementation
All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `results`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.


## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/visionjo/facerec-bias-bfw.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO/archive/master.zip).

## Dependencies

You'll need a working Python environment to run the code.
The recommended way to set up your environment is through the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
provides the `conda` package manager.
Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
the system Python installation.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `environment.yml`.

We use `conda` virtual environments to manage the project dependencies in
isolation.
Thus, you can install our dependencies without causing conflicts with your
setup (even with different Python versions).

Run the following command in the repository folder (where `environment.yml`
is located) to create a separate environment and install all required
dependencies in it:

    conda env create


## Reproducing the results

Before running any code you must activate the conda environment:

    source activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

or, if you're on Windows:

    activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.
Any subsequent commands will use software that is installed in the environment.

To build and test the software, produce all results and figures, and compile
the manuscript PDF, run this in the top level of the repository:

    make all

If all goes well, the manuscript PDF will be placed in `manuscript/output`.

You can also run individual steps in the process using the `Makefile`s from the
`code` and `manuscript` folders. See the respective `README.md` files for
instructions.

Another way of exploring the code results is to execute the Jupyter notebooks
individually.
To do this, you must first start the notebook server by going into the
repository top level and running:

    jupyter notebook

This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
interface. In the page, go into the `code/notebooks` folder and select the
notebook that you wish to view/run.

The notebook is divided into cells (some have text while other have code).
Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code
and produces it's output.
To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order.
